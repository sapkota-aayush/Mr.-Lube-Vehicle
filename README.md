Mr. Lube Vehicle Management Software
Overview
This project is an imitation of the Mr. Lube Automotive Repairing Software, inspired by my past work as a technician at Mr. Lube. The software is built using C++ and MySQL, with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Key Features
‚úÖ Add vehicle information and check if it exists in the database.
‚úÖ Retrieve previous service history.
‚úÖ Perform new services and update the database.
‚úÖ Process payments and view payment history.
‚úÖ Send receipts to customers via email using the SendGrid API.
‚úÖ Secure authentication system for users.
‚úÖ Uses cURL for HTTP requests and nlohmann/json for JSON handling.
‚úÖ Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Qt for an enhanced user experience.
Project Structure
The project consists of 11 files: 5 header files and their corresponding 5 implementation files, along with main.cpp as the entry point.

Header Files (.h)
authsystem.h - Handles authentication.
services.h - Manages vehicle services.
payment.h - Handles payment transactions.
utility.h - Contains utility functions (e.g., validation).
vehicle.h - Manages vehicle data and service history.
Source Files (.cpp)
authsystem.cpp - Implements authentication logic.
services.cpp - Implements service functionalities.
payment.cpp - Implements payment processing.
utility.cpp - Implements utility/helper functions.
vehicle.cpp - Implements vehicle management.
main.cpp - The main entry point that ties everything together.
Installation Guide
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Install MySQL and Configure Database
Follow this guide to set up MySQL in Visual Studio for a C++ application:
MySQL Setup Guide

2. Install Required Libraries
nlohmann/json (for JSON parsing)
Install the nlohmann/json library via vcpkg:

sh
Copy
Edit
vcpkg install nlohmann-json
Or download it manually from the nlohmann/json GitHub repository.

cURL (for HTTP requests - Sending emails via API)
Install cURL on Windows:

sh
Copy
Edit
vcpkg install curl
Link cURL to your C++ project in Visual Studio:

Go to Project Properties > C/C++ > Additional Include Directories
Add the path to cURL's include directory.
Qt (for GUI development)
Download and install Qt from the Qt Official Site.
Configure Qt in your development environment:
Add Qt include and library paths to your project settings.
Ensure the correct Qt version is selected in your IDE.
Usage
Authentication - Log in to the system.
Vehicle Lookup - Enter vehicle details to check service history.
Service Addition - Add new services to the selected vehicle.
Payment Processing - Handle payments and generate receipts.
Email Receipt - Send a receipt to the customer via the SendGrid API.
User Interface - Perform all operations using the Qt-based GUI.
API Configuration (SendGrid for Email)
Sign up at SendGrid.
Generate an API key.
Store the key in an environment variable or a config file.
Screenshots / Demonstrations
Due to some Visual Studio Code 2022 issues, I have not pushed the code yet. However, you can view the screenshots and demonstrations of the software via this Google Drive folder.

Why This Project?
This project is a practical demonstration of how OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) simplifies software design and maintenance by abstracting underlying complexity. It mimics real-world software used in the automotive industry to manage vehicle services efficiently.

Future Enhancements
Expand GUI features with more interactive elements.
Implement multi-user authentication roles (e.g., Admin, Technician).
Improve error handling and logging.
Expand email templates for better customer communication.
